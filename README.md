Going through Jack Watling's "The Arms of the Future" through the AI lens

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and Streamlit-based dashboards for visualizing interactive simulations of the situations described in the book. Currently implemented:

* Radar Simulation: Visualizes movements and radar-specific metrics.
* Spectrometer Simulation: Allows dynamic adjustment of event characteristics.
* Seismic Simulation: Simulates seismic responses with customizable parameters.
